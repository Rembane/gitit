# DTEK wiki, powered by Gitit

This is the source code of the wiki software used on the Computer Science and Engineering Student Division at Chalmers University of Technology.

It is more or less a standard gitit ([gitit's Github page](https://github.com/jgm/gitit)) distribution with a patch to enable LDAP authentication ([github link to commit](https://github.com/avdv/gitit/commit/075892367608ea609506463d2a5ceebbf3330c2f))

A slightly modified filestore is also used to show when pages were updated instead of when they were imported (useful if migrating from an old wiki).
